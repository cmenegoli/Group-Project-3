Data Visualization track

On this project we aim to show the data collected on emissions and waste management from Oil and Gas over the years and per capita.

The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) tracks the management of certain toxic chemicals that may pose a threat to human health and the environment. Certain industrial facilities in the U.S. must report annually how much of each chemical is recycled, combusted for energy recovery, treated for destruction, and disposed of or otherwise released on- and off-site. This information is collectively referred to as production-related waste managed.

Data exploration: For the analysis, we used the following official website for the Environmental Protection Agency.
