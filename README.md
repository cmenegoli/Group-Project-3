Project Overview

This project aims to visualize and analyze data on emissions and waste management from the oil and gas sector over various years and per capita. We focus on data collected by the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), which tracks the management of certain toxic chemicals that may pose a threat to human health and the environment.

Data Sources

The data for our analysis is sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and includes metrics on how much of each chemical is recycled, combusted for energy recovery, treated for destruction, or otherwise released on-site and off-site. This information is collectively referred to as production-related waste managed.
